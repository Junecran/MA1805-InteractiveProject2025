**Design Choices**

## Debrief

- could have probably coding a randomise maze but happy acciendent that it could respresent that after learning the bad online you can be safter = faster at solving the maze
- could have found an easier way to get the map done without doing it by hand
- wanted faster/smoother movement but couldnt figure it out as coding has betrayed me 
- movement sliding was cool but couldnt figure out a turning title system
- find more about pathfinding systems 
- gonna do an png background for the menu but liked the resized thing too much
- transparte menu but made colours weird
- having a set spawn point to the player and emenies so the reset button would keep getting fucked up
- pop ui randomise 
- back button sucks ass
